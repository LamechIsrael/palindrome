# palindrome

This is a project I made for class to find out if a word is a palindrome.
I realize now that I could have gotten a range of the string and cut the word into two strings.
Then I could have reversed one and checked to see if the two were the same.

But in any case, this checker will work whether the letters of a string are even or odd.
